# Office Hours Location and Format

Following Univerersity and College guidance, this semester we will
hold office hours remotely. Our TA staff will use the [Khoury Office
Hours system](https://khouryofficehours.com/), helping students on a
first-come, first-serve basis. Please see the [OH calendar](#calendar)
below. 



### Jason

I'll be active on Khoury Office Hours Tuesdays 12pm-2pm Eastern. I'll
also be in my office (West Village H #326) during that time, so we can 
meet and talk in person if you prefer. If people come to both, I'll 
trade off or combine when I can. I'm also available outside of those 
hours by appointment. Email preferred. 

### Ryan

I will active on Khoury Office Hours Wednesdays 6pm-8pm Eastern.

However, you don't need to wait a week to talk to me. Here's how you can reach me when I'm not holding OH, in order of preference:

1. See me after class, we can talk outside the classroom. I'll be in lecture most days until May 20th.
2. [Book a time to meet with me](https://calendly.com/jung-ry/meeting).
3. Send an [email](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/) to `jung.ry@northeastern.edu`.
4. DM me on Teams ðŸ¤®.

I will almost always be free to answer questions and meet during key times (right before homeworks are due and in the week preceeding exams).

### Cindy

I will be holding my office hours Thurdays 12-2pm EST.

You can also send me an email at `luo.xiny@northeastern.edu` if you have any other questions outside of my office hours. I will be happy to meet virtually or in person if I am available :)

I might be _hard_ to reach out from teams, but I usually respond to emails pretty fast :) If I don't reply within a day, feel free to shoot me another email when necessary!
