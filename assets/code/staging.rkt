#| Staging and Partial Evaluation |#

;; Never put off until run time what you can do at compile time.
;;
;; -- David Gries, in "Compiler Construction for Digital Computers",
;; circa 1969.

#| Assignment Guidelines |#

;; Throughout this assignment, I suggest you avoid eta reductions even
;; when possible. This is the sort of assignment where you would wish
;; you have a type system to help you keep your parameters straight.

;; I suggest you perform these as nested, whole-program
;; transformations, and save waypoints along the way, even when we
;; don't ask you to.

;; We have given you a traditional, 4400-style interpreter. It does
;; not match its test cases, though. It's test cases expect to take in
;; its arguments /curried/ (or schönfinkeled, if you prefer).

;; 1. Rewrite the following interpreter so that it takes in its
;; arguments in a curried fashion. You should curry out the parameters
;; to your interpreter and curry the parameters in every one of your
;; interpreter's recursive calls. Also curry out the parameters to
;; your (CPSed) environment. Please don't do something clever like
;; writing a "help interpreter" that uncurries and passes them along,
;; or use a letrec or any such mishegas. You must "sink in" each
;; parameter as far as possible (specifically, the env-cps and k; expr
;; must stay where it is) Do not curry out your closures. You will
;; sometimes find you have to duplicate a lambda expression over both
;; sides of an if expression. The test suite is inadequate, you must
;; add your own.

To further clarify this transformation, we have transformed here for
you one of your interpreter's clauses

;; 2. Copy your interpreter from 1. above, and name this copy
;; valof-pe. You will here "lift up" evaluable sub-expressions as far
;; as possible, so that you do as much work as possible before taking
;; in the parameter. We have provided you tests below for this version
;; of the program. You know your transformation is correct when all
;; calls to valof-pe finish before taking in an environment. This will
;; not be the case for your environment and continuations,
;; however. The test suite is inadequate, you must add your own.

Think: Why is it that we can ensure all calls to valof-pe are finished
(i.e. completed) before ever evaluating an environment. Why /can't/ we
make that guarantee about environments before continuations?

Answer:

;; 3b.

Think: why is it okay to evaluate these sub-expressions out of order?
Why are we (why am I) not concerned about causing unfortunate infinite
loops?
